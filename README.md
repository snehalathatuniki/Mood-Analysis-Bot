# Mood-Analysis-Bot
The bot uses the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on user-inputted text and outputs an emoji representing the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative). It can be easily customized with a sensitivity setting that adjusts the threshold for how sensitive the bot is to changes in sentiment.
